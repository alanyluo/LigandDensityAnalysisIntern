This repository contains the Python and bash scripts used for the Ligand Electron Density Analysis research project.
This repository was created to present my code to prospective employers. The original repository contains these code as well as all the data that I collected. These data were acquired from running these scripts. They are excluded here due to the sheer collective amount of storage that they occupy.
