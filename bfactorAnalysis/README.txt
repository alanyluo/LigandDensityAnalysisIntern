There were multiple attempts to get meaningful results for the bfactor analysis. Each of these attempts is numbered based on when they were acquired (e.g. results1 was the first to be acquired).
For each attempt, the script that was used to get it is included in that directory.
The last script that was used is bfactorAnalysis/code/script.sh. This may be any one of these scripts.
results1: initial attempt; universal ranking cutoff of 0.5
results2: anyCutoff=0.9, avgCutoff=0.5; started printing out the fractional ranking cutoff, the minimum and maximum number of atoms that were analyzed, and the total number of sites that were analyzed (the last of which is just the sum of the values in the Fisher's exact test table)
